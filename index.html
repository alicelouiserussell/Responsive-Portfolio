      <p>Hello! I'm new to the world of coding. I've spent the last 5 years working in Human Services throughout Boston and the Seacoast. This is a big and exciting change for me. I like creating, exploring, and eating. Any activity that involves all three is a winner for me. My dream job is a role where I am able to push myself creatively in an enviornment that is continually changing and challenging. I like to think and solve poroblems creatively, and I'm looking for a shift in my career. Even in progressing through the pre-work, I'm encouraged and excited to be starting this journey.
